/*
Create two variables: name (a String) and age (an Int). Assign values to these variables. Then, use string
interpolation to print the phrase "My name is NAME, and I am AGE years old."

For example, if name = "Michael" and age = 20, then the program should print:
"My name is Michael, and I am 20 years old."
