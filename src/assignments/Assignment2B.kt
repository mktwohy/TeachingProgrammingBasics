/* Assignment 2B

Topics:
- functions
- user input
- arithmetic operators

Look back on Assignment 2A. Notice how this results in repetitive code. So, create a function called "calculateTip."
calculateTip will take the bill amount (Float) and tip percentage (Float) as an input, and will print
the tip amount and bill total after tip. The function does not return any value.
