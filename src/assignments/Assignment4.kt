/* Assignment 4

Topics:
- functions
- while loops
- incrementing

Create a function called multiply that takes two Int values Misc.and returns the product of the two
(which should also be an Int). You are not allowed to use the * operator, however. Instead, you should
use a combination of a while loop Misc.and addition

Note that multiplication is just adding multiple times. For example:
3 * 4 =
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 =
12
