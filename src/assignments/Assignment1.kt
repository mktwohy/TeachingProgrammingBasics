/* Assignment 1

Topics:
- variables
- using temp variables
- string interpolation

In this assignment, you will practice swapping around variable values. Create three integer variables: a,b,c.
Initialize each of them to have a different value. Print out the initial values. Depending on the values you pick, your
output should look something like this:

Initially: a is 10, b is 9, c is 8

Without hard-coding numbers, swap the values so that b gets a, c gets b, and a gets c. Then, print the results of the
swap. Example output:

After first swap: a is 8, b is 10, c is 9

Swap and print one last time. Example output:

After second swap: a is 9, b is 8, c is 10
